#
# A company is planning to interview 2n people. Given the array costs where
# costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti],Â the cost of flying the i^th person to city a is
# aCosti, and the cost of flying the i^th person to city b is bCosti.
# 
# Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n
# people arrive in each city.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
# Output: 110
# Explanation: 
# The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
# The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
# The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
# The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
# 
# The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people
# interviewing in each city.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
# Output: 1859
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: costs =
# [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
# Output: 3086
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 2 * n == costs.length
# 2 <= costs.length <= 100
# costs.length is even.
# 1 <= aCosti, bCosti <= 1000
#
